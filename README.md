Ethereum-based decentralized loan processing system is designed to enhance security, transparency, and efficiency. It utilizes decentralized identity verification with zero-knowledge proofs for secure KYC, ensuring privacy while preventing fraud. Smart contracts automate loan processing, eliminating bribery risks and manual approvals. The system integrates AI-powered credit scoring via Chainlink oracles for dynamic risk assessment and uses stablecoins for instant loan disbursements. NFT-based collateralization allows borrowers to lock tokenized real-world assets, which are automatically liquidated in case of default. The system is fully digital, paperless, and tamper-proof, with real-time loan monitoring and automated penalty enforcement.
